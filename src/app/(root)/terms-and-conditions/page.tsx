      content: `Welcome to Cricstock11, an innovative, cricket-based fantasy gaming platform that introduces a unique stock-market-style experience for cricket enthusiasts. Cricstock11 allows users to virtually buy and sell shares of cricket batsmen and teams during live matches. The share values are influenced by real-time match performances — when a batsman scores, their stock value increases, and so does the stock value of the team they represent. Conversely, missed deliveries, dot balls, and dismissals lead to a decrease in stock values. A batsman getting out causes their stock to drop to 50% of the last buying price, affecting the team's valuation accordingly.

Cricstock11 is developed to offer a skill-based gaming experience where success depends on users' cricket knowledge, analytical skills, and strategic decision-making. The platform does not support or promote any form of real-money gambling.

By accessing or registering on Cricstock11, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms & Conditions ("Terms"), our Privacy Policy, and other applicable rules and policies. Please read them carefully before participating.`,
